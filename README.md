pset 2 - skteching, graph inferences, shortest-path tree checking

pset 3 - dyamic programming: task productivity, sketching with outliers, graph traversal 

pset 4 - recursive algorithms: quality vs price comparisons, matrix multiplication, multiple slopes

pset 5 - flow optimization: inference in graphs, maximum in-set, highly active subsets

pset 6 - NP-hardness problems: binary fixed point, densest bipartite induced subgraph, vertex cover

pset 7 - NP-hardness problems: class scheduling, linear equations with outliers, fair teams,
